# Full Dev Guide

This guide is from the perspective of creating a new datapack, but should be able to be easily adapted to converting a non-SlimeCore-loaded datapack into a SlimeCore-loaded datapack. If you are converting a datapack, it is highly advised to make a backup beforeso.

## Setup

### Pack ID

Designate a namespace (`<datapack>/data/<namespace>`) as your datapack's **pack ID**. This namespace must be the only namespace that your datapack defines ***new*** files in.

All other namespaces included in your datapack are considered *secondary namespaces* (e.g. `minecraft`, `slimecore`, pack IDs of your datapack's dependencies). Your datapack must not define any new files within secondary namespaces, but may *overwrite/modify* files in them (e.g. appending to a tag).

### Function Tags

SlimeCore-loaded datapacks require the following function tags:
```
<datapack>
└── data
    ├── slimecore/tags/function
    │   └── manifest.json
    └── <pack ID>/tags/function
        ├── disable.json
        ├── load.json
        ├── safe_mode.json
        └── uninstall.json
```

Do **NOT** include the `#minecraft:load` or `#minecraft:tick` tags.
